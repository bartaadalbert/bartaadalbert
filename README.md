### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ At present, I am concentrating on building a streaming business featuring a robust admin control panel, improved user experience with interactive bots, and seamless payment processing directly through the bots themselves.
- ðŸŒ± I'm expanding my knowledge and practical experience in Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins. I have some familiarity with these tools, and I'm looking to deepen my understanding and skills through further exploration and hands-on practice.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am seeking collaboration opportunities in the field of DevOps, with a focus on creating automated systems and cloud-based infrastructure to streamline and optimize development and deployment processes.
- ðŸ¤” I'm seeking assistance in improving my communication skills and fostering collaboration with people who share similar interests. It's challenging for me to effectively engage and work together with others, so I would like to learn strategies and approaches to connect with like-minded individuals more easily.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about streaming video solutions, Ubuntu server management, network configurations, payment integrations, automating payment processes, sending marketing emails, and utilizing social messaging platforms such as Telegram, Viber, and others for effective communication and engagement.
